$NetBSD: README,v 1.1 2001/02/07 01:20:54 bjh21 Exp $

This is a pile of programs to allow a NetBSD system to act as a very basic
AUN (Acorn Universal Networking) fileserver.  This release is intended to
be just about good enough to get a NetBSD/arm26 system booting from it.

Hints:

copy aund.conf to /etc
edit /etc/aund.conf, notably the "urd" line.
populate the URD with !ArmBoot,feb, BBBB,ffb and netbsd.
# ifconfig fxp0 alias 1.0.128.254
$ aund
*Configure FileSystem Net
*Configure Boot
*Configure BootNet on
*Configure FS 254

If you have problems using aund to boot NetBSD/arm26, talk to
<port-arm26@netbsd.org>.  For all other stuff relating to aund, try
<bjh21@netbsd.org>.  Note, though, that support effort available for this
code is minimal.
