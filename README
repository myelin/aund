aund is a program to allow a Unix system to act as an AUN or Econet
fileserer.  It supports:

* Clients from System 3 to RISC OS 3.70 (and probably later)
* Servers running Linux, NetBSD and probably others
* Connectivity by AUN (over UDP) or BeebEm emulated Econet
* Read/write operation
* Multiple virtual users (all under one Unix UID)

Hints:

copy aund.conf to /etc
edit /etc/aund.conf, notably the "urd" line.
populate the URD with !ArmBoot,feb, BBBB,ffb and netbsd.
# ifconfig fxp0 alias 1.0.128.254
$ aund
*Configure FileSystem Net
*Configure Boot
*Configure BootNet on
*Configure FS 254

If you have problems using aund to boot NetBSD/arm26, talk to
<port-arm26@netbsd.org>.  For all other stuff relating to aund, try
<bjh21@netbsd.org>.  Note, though, that support effort available for this
code is minimal.
